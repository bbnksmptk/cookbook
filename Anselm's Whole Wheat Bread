- Makes two loaves 

1 teaspoon dry yeast
3/4 cups scalded skim milk
1 1/3 cups water
1/6 cups honey
1/6 cups molasses
1/3 cups wheat germ
1 cup oat bran
3 cups Pillsbury whole wheat flour
1 egg, separated
2 teaspoons salt
1/3 cup corn oil
4-6 cups Pillsbury all-purpose flour
(optional) sesame or poppy seeds


1. The sponge: In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in mixture of warm milk, water, honey and molasses. Allow to stand for 5-10 mins until yeast is bubbly. Stir in wheat germ, Pillsbury whole wheat flour, oat bran and egg yolk . Loosely cover the bowl and allow the sponge to rise for one hour in a warm place.

2. The second rising: stir in salt, oil and 2-3 cups of Pillsbury all-purpose flour. Turn dough onto  floured pastry board. 
Knewd in 2-3 additionall cups of flour until the dough is smooth and elastic and no longer sticks to the board or your hands.
Return to the bowl, cover and allow to rise for 1 hour in a warm place.

3. Shaping the loaves/the third rising: Turn the dough out again onto the pastry board. Punch down and knewd briefly.
Divide the dough into two equal parts. To shape the loaf, roll out the dough with a rolling pin or the flat of your hands to a rectangle. Beginning with the short side, roll it up toward you, as tight as a jelly roll. Tuck ends under and place in well-greased loaf pan, seam side down. Repeat for the other loaf. Cover loaves with damp towel and allow to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour (to the top of the pans).

4. Baking: whip egg white lightly with a fork. Brush white on top of loaves. Sprinkle with sesame/poppy seeds. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hours. (Check for unever baking after 30 minutes and, if necessary, rotate the pans in the oven). Remove from pans and cool on racks.
